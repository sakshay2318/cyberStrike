# RED TEAM WEB-EXPLOIT TOOLKIT

The cyberStrike repository is a comprehensive toolkit designed for conducting simulated cyber attacks, specifically tailored for red team operations. 
It encompasses various scripts and tools aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications, networks, and systems.

## Overview

The CyberStrike project is a comprehensive toolkit designed for web exploitation, leveraging various Python libraries and frameworks such as Flask, Scapy, and BeautifulSoup to conduct a wide range of 
cyber security assessments. It includes functionalities like network scanning, packet sniffing, SQL injection detection, endpoint analysis, open redirect detection, cross-site scripting checks, 
HTTP security header inspection, TLS security assessment, and more. 

The application provides a graphical user interface for easy interaction, allowing users to execute different types of scans and view the results in a structured manner. Additionally, it supports 
capturing and logging keystrokes for further analysis, enhancing its capabilities for advanced penetration testing scenarios.

## Features

- **Network Scanning**: Identify active hosts and services across a network.
- **Packet Sniffing**: Capture and analyze network traffic for insights into communication patterns and potential exploits.
- **SQL Injection Detection**: Scan for SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications.
- **Endpoint Analysis**: Analyze web endpoints for common security issues.
- **Open Redirect Detection**: Identify URLs that could lead to phishing or other attacks.
- **Cross-Site Scripting Checks**: Detect XSS vulnerabilities in web applications.
- **HTTP Security Header Inspection**: Evaluate the security posture of web servers.
- **TLS Security Assessment**: Assess the configuration and strength of TLS connections.
- **Keystroke Logging**: Capture and log keystrokes for deeper analysis.
